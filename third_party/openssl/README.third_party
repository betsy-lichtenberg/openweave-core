Description:

  OpenSSL Cryptography Library

Local Modifications:

  A number of minor changes have been made to the original OpenSSL code:
  
  -- The OpenSSL build system has been modified such that it's possible to build the
  cryptographic library (libcrypto) only.
  
  -- Small changes to the Configure script have been made to better support building on
  Android and iOS.
  
  -- A new implementation of the J-PAKE cryptographic authentication protocol has been 
  introduced based on elliptic curves.
  
  Patches capturing the above changes can be found in the patches/ directory.
