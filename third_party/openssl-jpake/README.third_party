Description:

  OpenSSL J-PAKE implementation
  
  This directory contains a copy of the OpenSSL J-PAKE code extracted from the OpenSSL
  source distribution and modified slightly to compile on its own.
  
  The following files originated from the OpenSSL source distribution:

    ./openssl/crypto/jpake/jpake.c
    ./openssl/crypto/jpake/jpake.h
    ./openssl/crypto/jpake/jpake_err.c
    ./openssl/crypto/jpake/jpaketest.c

Local Modifications:

  -- The jpake.h header file was modified to defeat the compilation-time check for the
  OPENSSL_NO_JPAKE flag.
  
  -- The jpake.c file was modified to eliminate reference to memory.h.
  
  -- A new implementation of the J-PAKE cryptographic authentication protocol based on
  elliptic curves has been added.  This implementation was authored by Nest and DID NOT
  originate from the OpenSSL source distribution.
